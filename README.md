# Langchain Laboratory

Langchain Laboratory is an open-source application built using [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) to provide developers and those interested in building Language Model (LLM) applications with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html).

## Features

- **Document Embedding**: The application provides a dashboard that allows users to upload PDF (.pdf) files, Mircosoft Word (.docx) files, and plain text (.txt) files. It creates embeddings of these documents and uploads the embeddings to a Chroma Vector Store.

- **Conversational Memory**: The application also provides a feature for conversational memory.

## Project Status

This project is a work in progress and contributions are encouraged. For more information, please contact [barweiss@cisco.com](mailto:barweiss@cisco.com).

## Licensing

This project is open source through MIT licensing.

## Compatibility

At this time, this application is only designed to work with the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 LLMs. However, in order to showcase the LangChain modularity and extensibility, we plan to add the ability to allow this tool to be used with any LLM in the future.
